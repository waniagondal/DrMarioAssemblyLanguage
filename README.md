A low-level implementation of the classic Dr. Mario puzzle game in assembly language. The game includes core mechanics such as coloured capsule generation, collision-detection, user-controlled movement using WASD, and match-based clearing. Smooth real-time animations are rendered at 60 frames per second. The additional features include a preview system for upcoming capsules, a pause and resume mechanic, animated sequences, and two blocks with special behaviours. The architecture of the game is grounded in efficient memory usage, real-time state transitions, and direct hardware-level manipulation for rendering and input handling. A deep understanding of low-level programming concepts such as memory management, real-time responsiveness, and graphical rendering in assembly was achieved.
